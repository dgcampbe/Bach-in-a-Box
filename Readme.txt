This is a little Python script I am making. It will hopefully be able to use a script to write baroque music to a file that can be read using Alda.

Alda can be found here: https://github.com/alda-lang/alda

That is my goal at this point. I am very confident that this is just a huge mess that will never work right, but it is fun for me to work on it.

Right now it is only able to write random notes to a file and a GUI is in the works using tkinter. Making this work with Alda is a relatively new idea, so it will nee a bit of a rewrite in order to accommodate it.
