This is a little Python script I am making. It will hopefully be able to use a script to write baroque music to a file that can be read using Alda.

Alda can be found here: https://github.com/alda-lang/alda

That is my goal at this point. I am very confident that this is just a huge mess that will never work right, but it is fun for me to work on it.

Right now it is only able to write random notes to a file and a GUI is in the works using tkinter. Making this work with Alda is a relatively new idea, so it will nee a bit of a rewrite in order to accommodate it.

I have been working on migrating to Linux so Linux-related things are in the works. I am working on making this program work in Linux.

I don't know how well tkinter of os.path work in Linux, I will do more research. This is mostly just for Windows for the time being though.

If for some reason the Linux version fails to work in Linux, try running dos2unix can on it.

Idk about other distros of Linux, but the dos2unix package is easy to get for Arch in the AUR.

I beleive that everything is working as fine as can be for Windows (excluding bugs in the program itself :P)

Still need a way to recognize that E# is F, etc.

I doubt anyone in the right mind would want to use this code for anything, but if you do feel free. :P
