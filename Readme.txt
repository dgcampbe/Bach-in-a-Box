This is a little Python script I am making. It will hopefully be able to use a script to write baroque music to a file that can be read using Alda.

Alda can be found here: https://github.com/alda-lang/alda

That is my goal at this point. I am very confident that this is just a huge mess that will never work right, but it is fun for me to work on it.

Right now it is only able to write random notes to a file and a GUI is in the works using tkinter. Making this work with Alda is a relatively new idea, so it will nee a bit of a rewrite in order to accommodate it.

I have been working on migrating to Linux so Linux-related things are in the works. I am working on making this program work in Linux.

If for some reason the Linux version fails to work in Linux, trying a command called dos2unix can on it should work.

Idk about other distros of Linux, but dos2unix is easy to get for Arch in the AUR.

If you are using Windows, I think everything would just work.

A little new to Github :)

I doubt anyone in the right mind would want to use this code for anything, but if you do feel free. :P
