This is a little Python script I am making. It will hopefully be a script to write baroque music. This will probably have extensive use of Music21 from MIT.

It feels like a lot of the work I did isn't needed since I found Music21.

Right now it is only able to write random notes to a file and a GUI is in the works using tkinter.

I have been working on migrating to Linux so Linux-related things are in the works. I am working on making this program work in Linux.

I don't know how well tkinter of os.path work in Linux, I will do more research. This is mostly just for Windows for the time being though.

If for some reason the Linux version fails to work in Linux, try running dos2unix can on it.

In the mean time the Windows version SHOULD work.

Idk about other distros of Linux, but the dos2unix package is easy to get for Arch in the AUR.

I beleive that everything is working as fine as can be for Windows (excluding bugs in the program itself :P)

I doubt anyone in the right mind would want to use this code for anything, but if you do feel free. :P
