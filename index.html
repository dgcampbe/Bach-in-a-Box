<p>Docs are a work-in-progress. Later, these pages will be all filled with music theory. I used to not be able to write fugues at all so I went to doctor for a cure. He prescribed something to make all of my fugues sound like Bach's. It worked so well I had to ask my doctor what is was that I was taking. He said "Oh, it's just a minor tonic,"</p>
