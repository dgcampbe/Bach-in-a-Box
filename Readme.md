This is a Python program designed to generate music in a baroque style, use counterpoint, and to handle calculations related to just intonation.

It makes extensive use of Music21 from MIT.

If the program doesn't run at all on Linux, run dos2unix can on it.

This SHOULD rectify the issue.

The dos2unix package is easy to get for Arch-based distrobutions in the AUR.

Possible features in the long term:

UI using electron instead of a messy, barely functioning tkinter UI

use of scipy and numpy for better mathematical calculations

less code that reinvents the wheel and performance improvments
