This is a Python program designed to generate music in a baroque style, use counterpoint, and to handle calculations related to just intonation.

Before running for the first time, run build.bat on Windows. --- not needed yet

It makes extensive use of:

-Music21 http://web.mit.edu/music21/
-PyQt5 https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/

If the program doesn't run at all on Linux, run dos2unix can on it. This SHOULD rectify the issue. The dos2unix package is easy to get for Arch-based distrobutions in the AUR.
