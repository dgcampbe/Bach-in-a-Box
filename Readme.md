<h1>Bach in a Box</h1>

<h2>This is a Python program designed to generate music in a baroque style, use counterpoint, and to handle calculations related to just intonation.</h2>

<h3>It makes extensive use of:</h3>

- [Music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/ "Music21")

- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/ "PyQt5")

Before running for the first time, run build.bat on Windows. --- not needed yet

If the program doesn't run at all on Linux, run dos2unix can on it. This SHOULD rectify the issue. The dos2unix package is easy to get for Arch-based distrobutions in the AUR.

<h3>Planned Features:</h3>

- User interface in PyQt5

- scipy and numpy for better mathematical calculations

- perhaps some SuperCollider for audio output 

- 100% cross-platform

- Less unneeded code and better performance
